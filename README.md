## EDA using Python 

(In Telco Customer Churn.ipynb)


## Conclusion from EDA


1. Short term contracts have higher churn rates.
2. Month to month contract is more likely opted by customers but has the greatest impact on the Churn rate (increases likelihood to churn by 6.31x).
3. Customers with a two yearly contract have a very low churn rate.
3. People with higher tenure are very less likely to churn as compared to shorter tenure (1 year).
3. The customers who pay through electronic checks have higher churn rate whereas the ones who pay through credit card have lower churn rate.
4. Customers without an internet service have a very low churn rate.
5. Customers who have Internet service as Fiber Optics as a service are more likely to Churn.
6. Senior Citizens are more likely to churn.
7. Additional features like Security, Backup, Device Protection and Tech Support make the customer less likely to churn.
